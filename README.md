# spark
Spark is a CPU profiling plugin based on sk89q's [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast).

### What does it do?

Effectively, it monitors the activity of the server, and records statistical data about which actions take up the most processing time. These statistics can then be used to diagnose potential performance issues with certain parts of the server or specific plugins.

Once the data has been recorded, a "call graph" can be formed and displayed in a web browser for analysis.

spark will not fix "lag" - it is a tool to help diagnose the cause of poor performance.

### About

#### WarmRoast features

These features are carried over from the upstream "WarmRoast" project.

* Adjustable sampling frequency.
* Web-based â€” profiling is performed on the server, but results are viewed in your browser.
* Collapse and expand nodes to see details.
* Easily view CPU usage per method at a glance.
* Hover to highlight all child methods as a group.
* See the percentage of CPU time for each method relative to its parent methods.

#### spark features

WarmRoast is an amazing tool for server admins, but it has a few flaws.

* It is not accessible to some people, because in order to use it, you need to have direct SSH (or equivalent) access to the server. (not possible on shared hosts)
* It can be somewhat clunky to setup and start - firstly, you need to connect to the machine of the server you want to profile. Then, you need to remember the PID of the server, or identify it in a list of running VM display names (not easy when multiple servers are running!) - then allow the profiler to run for a bit, before navigating to a temporary web server hosted by the process.
* It's not easy to share profiling data with other developers or admins.

I've attempted to address these flaws. With spark, you can:

* Easily setup profiling operations using commands in the console or in-game, without having to have direct access to the server machine
* Profiling data is uploaded to a "pastebin"-esque site to be viewed - a temporary web server is not needed, and you can easily share your analysis with others!

#### How does it work?

The spark (WarmRoast) profiler operates using a technique known as [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)#Statistical_profilers). A sampling profiler works by probing the target programs call stack at regular intervals in order to determine how frequently certain actions are being performed. In practice, sampling profilers can often provide a more accurate picture of the target program's execution than other approaches, as they are not as intrusive to the target program, and thus don't have as many side effects.

Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific than other profiling methods (e.g. instrumentation), but allow the target program to run at near full speed.

The resultant data is not exact, but a statistical approximation. The accuracy of the output improves as the sampler runs for longer durations, or as the sampling interval is reduced.

#### spark vs "Minecraft Timings"

Aikar's [timings](https://github.com/aikar/timings) system is similar to spark/WarmRoast, in the sense that it also analyses the CPU activity of the server.

The biggest drawback of timings is that each area of analysis has to be manually defined.

For example, timings might identify that a certain listener in pluginx is taking up a lot of CPU time processing the PlayerMoveEvent, but it won't tell you which part of the processing is intensive. spark/WarmRoast on the other hand *will* show this information.

### Installation

To install, add the **spark.jar** file to your servers plugins/mods directory, and then restart your server.

### Commands

All commands require the `spark.profiler` permission.

___
#### `/profiler start`
Starts a new profiling operation.

**Arguments**
* `--timeout <timeout>`
	* Specifies how long the profiler should run before automatically stopping. Measured in seconds.
	* If left unspecified, the profiler will run indefinitely, until it is stopped
* `--thread <thread name>`
	* Specifies the name of the thread to be profiled.
	* If left unspecified, the profiler will only sample the main "server thread".
	* The `*` character can be used in place of a name to mark that all threads should be profiled
* `--interval <interval>`
	* Specifies the interval between samples. Measured in milliseconds.
	* Lower values will improve the accuracy of the results, but may result in server lag.
	* If left unspecified, a default interval of 10 milliseconds is used.
___
#### `/profiler info`
Prints information about the active profiler, if present.

___
#### `/profiler stop`
Ends the current profiling operation, uploads the resultant data, and returns a link to view the call graph.

___
#### `/profiler cancel`
Cancels the current profiling operation, and discards any recorded data without uploading it.
